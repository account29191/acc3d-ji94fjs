      Hello,
      <br />
      Hope all is well.
      <br />
      If you are reading this, I have probably sent you my resume. I would
      like to thank your for your time to consider me as a candidate. I have
      three years experience building websites with progressive skills
      gained along the way. Previously, I have worked in labs, a pharmacy, a
      zoo, and the Sacramento county government. I am progressing my career
      daily and am looking for the next challenge.
    </p>
    <p class="pastExperienceText">
      I would like to consider this site as a demonstration of what I can
      help build for you and your orginization. This site's code can be
      found on GitHub if you click the API button on the left side of the
      screen. It is built with custom HTML5, CSS and some JavaScript ES6
      functions. I will be adding a React site which will be over the top
      for what the content is, but it will demonstrate my ability. Also, I
      have been learning Swift for the past three months and am looking to
      add my first app to the App store in January 2020. Please see my next
      six months goals shown in the chart below. I hope to get to work with
      you someday!
      <br />
      Kind Regards,
      <br />
      Don

              <p>As I started to code my first line of HTML back in 2016,
                I thought this was going to be an easy journey. I was wrong.
                I severely underestimated the importance of creating a solid
                HTML backbone as the CSS and JavaScript which I didn't understand yet
                would be so dependent on the HTML layout. Each project I start,
                I put more thought into how this will be layed out for a smoother process
                in later stages of the project.

              CSS in my opinion is just as much an art as a technical skill.
              It really is a never ending journey to perfect the way elements look
              on the page. After learning the basics, I started to use CSS animation and still do
              in most of my projects. I prefer CSS Animate but am comfortable with other libraries.
              I learned Bootstrap but quickly realized that it is very limiting as you have to work within
              the framework. I then started to learn preprocessors Sass and Less. I prefer Less as it's JavaScript based.
              I can implement CSS animations natively like these flip boxes, but prefer to handle everything
              with JavaScript to separate concerns. One of my goals is to take on D3.js in 2020 to increase
              my page visulizations.

            JavaScript for me was not easy to pick up. It took about a year of solid practice and I still
            feel like I only know the basics to get things done. I'm unable to write a program that is worthy to be published in the 
            language. One of the toughest things for me was being able to figure out where to start. It's a completely
            different thought process than what I was used to. Then the next challenging part of picking up JavaScript was figuring
            out the MVC model and how it worked with the DOM and CSS concurrently. I feel much much more confident in JavaScript after 
            a few years of practicing and reading You Don't Know JS. Then learning ES6 was a challenge including to use Filter, Map, Reduce, arrow functions, 
            async, import-export modules, etc. This was needed to gain a solid foundation for API calls and React. I will never master this language,
             but since it was my first programming language I will always be striving to improve on it.

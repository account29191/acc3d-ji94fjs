      Hello,
      <br />
      Hope all is well.
      <br />
      If you are reading this, I have probably sent you my resume. I would
      like to thank your for your time to consider me as a candidate. I have
      three years experience building websites with progressive skills
      gained along the way. Previously, I have worked in labs, a pharmacy, a
      zoo, and the Sacramento county government. I am progressing my career
      daily and am looking for the next challenge.
    </p>
    <p class="pastExperienceText">
      I would like to consider this site as a demonstration of what I can
      help build for you and your orginization. This site's code can be
      found on GitHub if you click the API button on the left side of the
      screen. It is built with custom HTML5, CSS and some JavaScript ES6
      functions. I will be adding a React site which will be over the top
      for what the content is, but it will demonstrate my ability. Also, I
      have been learning Swift for the past three months and am looking to
      add my first app to the App store in January 2020. Please see my next
      six months goals shown in the chart below. I hope to get to work with
      you someday!
      <br />
      Kind Regards,
      <br />
      Don

                I thought this was going to be an easy journey. I was wrong.
                I severely underestimated the importance of creating a solid
                HTML backbone as the CSS and JavaScript which I didn't understand yet
                would be so dependent on the HTML layout. Each project I start,
                I put more thought into how this will be laid out for a smoother process
                in later stages of the project.

              CSS in my opinion is just as much an art as a technical skill.
              It really is a never ending journey to perfect the way elements look
              on the page. After learning the basics, I started to use CSS animations moved onto 
              Bootstrap and pre-processors Sass & Less. I can implement CSS animations natively 
              like these flip boxes, but prefer to handle everything
              with JavaScript to separate concerns. One of my goals is to take on D3.js in 2020 to increase
              my page visulizations.

            I am not an expert in JavaScript, but I can get things done. I started learning the basics,
            solving simple problems and went on to learn how to manipulate the DOM. I then moved on to learning how
            to work with different libraries with ES6 and calling APIs which would lead me to my first framework - React.
            React is overkill for many of my previous projects as I find it quicker to put together a page with 
            only HTML, CSS and ES6, however for me React shines when working with a group because of the consistency in the code.
